# FORMS ARE HARD ðŸ™ƒ
But everything is a form. And everything will continue to be a form until all the robots just talk to each other - that's probably the day I'll be able to retire. Until then, I'll keep working on forms and making them easier to implement.

## Intro: *How did we get here?*

From jQuery Validation to AngularJS to Redux Form to Formik, I've spent way too many late nights working on form libraries. It's been a large part of my web development career as a front-end developer starting in the early 2010s. 


## Inspiration

Now everything is trending back to "using the platform" with this concept of progressive enhancement. I'm a big fan of Ryan Florence [(@ryanflorence)](https://x.com/ryanflorence) and Michael Jackson [(@mjackson)](https://x.com/mjackson)'s work on [Remix](https://x.com/remix_run). Also, Alem Tuzlak [(@AlemTuzlak)](https://x.com/AlemTuzlak) and Thomas Fritz [(@thomasf)](https://x.com/thomasf)'s work on Remix Hook Form (and Remix Dev Tools) with their agency Forge42 [(@forge42dev)](https://x.com/forge42dev).

Special shoutout to Edmund Hung [(@edmundhung)](https://x.com/edmundhung) for his work on [React Conform](https://x.com/react_conform) which is another great library for working with forms. His stuff is so cool that people like Kent C. Dodds [(@kentcdodds)](https://x.com/kentcdodds) have adopted his library into his Epic Web stack.


## Goals

1. Extremely easy implementation in React Frameworks such as Next.js and Remix.
2. Well tested, documented, and maintained.
3. Forward thinking - for example React 19 is coming and it has a few new features that could make working with forms even easier.

## WIP

This is a work in progress. Please don't hesitate to message me with questions or collaboration opportunities.

Next up:

- [ ] Add a few Next.js Examples
- [ ] Add more components (React Select?)
- [ ] Add some AI specific documentation - usefull for prompts and writing tests
- [ ] Rename Default stories to Test stories and provide documentation on how they are used by the test runner with the play command.
- [ ] Add documentation of base components to Storybook without tests (maybe they can have visual regression tests in the future)
