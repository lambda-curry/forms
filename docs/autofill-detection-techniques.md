# Autofill Detection Techniques Comparison

This document provides a comparison of different techniques for detecting browser autofill events in web forms.

## Overview

Browser autofill is a convenient feature that automatically fills in form fields with previously saved information. However, it presents challenges for developers:

1. **Inconsistent behavior** across browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
2. **Limited events** - browsers don't provide standard events for autofill
3. **Styling challenges** - autofilled inputs have browser-specific styling
4. **Validation integration** - autofilled values may bypass validation

## Detection Techniques

We'll explore the following techniques for detecting when a browser has autofilled form fields:

1. **Value comparison with useRef**
   - Track initial and current values to detect changes not triggered by user input
   - Implementation in `feature/autofill-value-comparison` branch

2. **CSS Animation Detection**
   - Use CSS animations and `animationstart` event to detect autofill-specific animations
   - Implementation in `feature/autofill-css-animation` branch

3. **Form State Monitoring**
   - Monitor form state changes to detect unexpected value changes
   - Implementation in `feature/autofill-form-state` branch

4. **Controlled Inputs with useController**
   - Use controlled inputs with React Hook Form's useController to detect value changes
   - Implementation in `feature/autofill-controlled-inputs` branch

## Comparison Criteria

Each technique will be evaluated based on:

1. **Browser Compatibility** - How well it works across Chrome, Firefox, Safari
2. **Reliability** - Consistency of detection
3. **Performance Impact** - Any noticeable performance issues
4. **Implementation Complexity** - How difficult it is to implement
5. **Maintenance Overhead** - Long-term maintenance considerations

## Implementation Notes

Each technique will be implemented in a separate branch with:
- A Storybook demo showing the technique in action
- Documentation of browser-specific behavior
- Integration with form validation
- Styling hooks for autofilled inputs

## Recommendations

Based on the comparison, we'll provide recommendations for:
- Best overall technique for most use cases
- Browser-specific considerations
- Fallback strategies for browsers with limited support
